# Executive Summary

OneStop Electronics' total sales from 2019 to 2022 reached $28M, with 108K total orders. The company's average order value (AOV) across all years stands at $260 per order.

- In 2020, the company experienced a significant spike in sales across all metrics. Sales revenue more than doubled to $10M, driven by a twofold increase in order volume (34K orders). The average order value also saw a 30% year-over-year (YoY) increase, reaching $300. March 2020 marked the highest month-over-month (MoM) growth in the company's history, with a 50% increase in sales. This surge can likely be attributed to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns.

- However, since 2020, the company has struggled to sustain the high sales levels seen during the pandemic. As global activities returned to normal, OneStop Electronics experienced a decline in YoY growth, with sales revenue dropping by 10% in 2021 and a sharper decline of 46% in 2022. AOV and order count have also followed a similair trend.
