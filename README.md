## Project Goals

OneStop Electronics has been collecting data on a variety of key elements, including orders, order statuses, customer information, products, and geographic data. However, the data is currently unrefined and underutilized, presenting both challenges and opportunities for unlocking valuable insights. 

In cleaning and analyzing OneStop's data, we can extract meaningful insights from the dataset to support the company’s various teams—including finance, sales, product, and marketing. By providing actionable data insights, our aim is to improve operational efficiencies and drive better decision-making, ultimately helping OneStop Electronics optimize its processes and deliver superior products globally.
