</p>

- In **2020**, the company experienced a **significant spike in sales** across all metrics. **Sales revenue more than doubled** to **$10M**, driven by a **twofold increase in order volume** (**34K orders**). **MacBook Air** sales were the main product driver of this spike, growing **384%** from 2019-2020. **March 2020** marked the **highest month-over-month (MoM) growth** in the company's history, with a **50% increase in sales**. This surge can likely be attributed to the impact of increased demand due to COVID-19 and the resulting lockdowns

- However, since 2020, the company has struggled to sustain the high sales levels seen during the pandemic. As global activities returned to normal, OneStop Electronics experienced **a decline in YoY growth**, with **sales revenue dropping by 10% in 2021** and a sharper decline of **46% in 2022**. **AOV and order count** have also followed a **similar trend**

<!--
The following analysis will provide key insights to help guide the company’s strategy moving forward, focusing on areas like geographical trends, product mix, and loyalty program performance. These insights will enable OneStop Electronics to take informed action and identify new opportunities for growth and efficiency as the company navigates post-pandemic challenges.

> ### Should the company keep the loyalty program?
<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3d0103b-fe83-4678-93c0-26669082ae15" height="90%" width="90%">

</p>

<!--https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57d9faa4-8884-4bcc-b714-8c6da342662b-->

The company introduced a loyalty program in 2019 to incentivize customers to make more frequent purchases. Five years later, they are evaluating whether to continue the program.

### Key Insights:
- Overall, non-loyalty members have outpaced loyalty members in total sales, generating **$17M** compared to **$11M**, with generally higher AOV (except in 2022)
- However, a **trend reversal** occurred after the first two years. Since then, loyalty members have **surpassed non-loyalty members** in both sales and order count
- Additionally, loyalty members' AOV has been steadily rising and, by 2022, exceeded the AOV of non-loyalty members

### Recommendation:
Although the data does not provide a decisive conclusion about the loyalty program's impact, the upward trend in loyalty members' performance, particularly in the last two years, suggests potential for future growth. Based on this, it is recommended to retain the loyalty program and closely monitor its performance over the next few years. The recent positive trends warrant further observation before making a long-term decision.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis and insights, the team recommends the following: 

### Seasonal Promotions
Given seasonal trends, we recommend OneStop Electronics considers implementing strategic promotions to either capitalize on or counteract these patterns. Some suggestions include:

- **Fall Savings Event**: Use bundled discounts on high-AOV items like the iPhone and MacBook Air, with a “Buy More, Save More” approach to drive higher-value purchases
- **Summer Essentials Sale**: Combat the summer sales lull with discounts on essentials (chargers, headphones, etc.) and free shipping to boost order volume
- **End-of-Year Clearance**: Run a November-December clearance on prior-year models, offering loyalty members early access and extra discounts to increase engagement

### Product Lineup
- **Bose Soundsport**'s consistently poor performance across all years and metrics warrants consideration for removal or replacement
- Work with product and sales teams to evaluate its viability and explore potential alternatives to optimize the product portfolio

### Strategies to Boost iPhone Sales

To capitalize on the Apple iPhone’s high average order value (AOV) and untapped growth potential, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Target High-Spending Customer Segments**: Direct marketing efforts toward segments with high-value purchasing patterns to drive more iPhone sales. Key targets include **website customers** (who average **$257 higher AOV** than app users), **loyalty members** (with higher average spending than non-members in 2022), and regions like the **US** (highest sales volume), **Japan**, and the **Netherlands** (highest AOV countries)
- **Leverage Cross-Selling Opportunities**: Bundle the iPhone with other Apple products, such as the MacBook Air and Apple AirPods, to encourage complementary purchases and increase the overall transaction value

The company should track the effectiveness of these campaigns closely, evaluating shifts in iPhone order volume and AOV. Using this data to refine marketing approaches, optimizing based on customer response and sales performance trends.

### Loyalty Program
- The performance of the loyalty program has been steadily improving, and it is recommended to **retain** the program while closely monitoring its results over the next few years
- To **boost engagement**, the company should consider introducing additional **benefits** and **targeted discounts** for loyalty members such as exclusive promotions and early access to new products

### Refund Rates
- Collaborate with the product team to investigate the high refund rates of the ThinkPad and MacBook Air laptops with a focus on reducing the amount of refunds associated with Apple products
